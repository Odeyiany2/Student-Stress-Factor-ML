# Student-Stress-Factor-Machine Learning


This Machine Learning project is aimed at understanding what impacts stress of Engineering students the most. The dataset for this project was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samyakb/student-stress-factors)

### Python Libraries
These are the libraries I used for this project: 
- Data Exploration & Preprocessing : `pandas` `numpy` 
- Data Visualization : `matplotlib` `seaborn`
- Machine Learning : `scikit-learn` `joblib`
- Deployment : `streamlit`

### Data Acquisition & Preprocessing Techniques
The following techniques were applied to preprocess the data:
- Renaming the columns
- Removing irrelevant columns and rows
